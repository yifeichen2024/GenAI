    Calculation Steps: 
1. Clearly outline every step of the calculation.
2. Ensure that intermediate results are accurate and match the mathematical operations described.
3. Verify the final result before providing the answer. Recheck the result by reversing the operation (e.g., subtraction to verify addition, division to verify multiplication).
